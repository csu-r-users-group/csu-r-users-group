      <description>Hello R-users,
This week, Matt will talk about how R works at a base level, including the Read Eval Print Loop, parsing of R code, scoping rules and how R finds variables and functions, and R&amp;rsquo;s data types.
We will also chat about a plan for the summer. If you&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to participate in R-group this spring but we&amp;rsquo;re able to because of scheduling now is the time to speak up!</description>

      <description>Hello R-users,
On Monday, April 29, Scott Haley will walk us through the basics of implementing mixed effects models in R. We&amp;rsquo;ll walk through differences between two packages commonly used for these models: nlme and lme4. Feel free to bring your own data to work with or just follow along with the group.
Hope to see you there! Plant Sciences C005 3pm.</description>
